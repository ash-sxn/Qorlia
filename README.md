# Qorlia

Qorlia delivers open-source software services and pragmatic AI augmentations that help organisations modernise operations without vendor lock-in.

## What We Do

- **Managed Open-Source Deployments** – Tailored implementations, hosting, and lifecycle support for battle-tested platforms like Bahmni (healthcare) and ERPNext (business management), with localisation for Indian and global teams.
- **AI Integration Layers** – Practical enhancements that turn existing data into guided workflows, predictive insights, and decision support, delivered via modular APIs and automation.
